# Smilebasic Games
- It is a game for Pasocommini MZ - 80C.
- You can load and run from Smilebasic.

## submarine_sb
- It is a game to sink a nostalgic submarine.
- I am referencing the machine language DEEPSCAN Modoki listed in the magazine I/O of the 1980's.
(Actually I have not played so I only resemble the atmosphere ...)
