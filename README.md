# Smilebasic Games
- It is a game for Pasocommini MZ - 80C.
- You can load and run from Smilebasic.

## submarine_sb
- It is a game to sink a nostalgic submarine.
- I am referencing the machine language DEEPSCAN Modoki listed in the magazine I/O of the 1980's.
(Actually I have not played so I only resemble the atmosphere ...)

## framework_sb_mz
- It is a model sample that displays Smilebasic text display on the MZ-80C side.
- By modifying cls, locate, print, text will be displayed on the emulator side.
- It is necessary to call every frame update function.

## blockball_sb_mz
- Block break of SmileBASIC for Petitcom was ported to SmileBASIC on Pasocommini.
- Original is from Mr. Takuya Matsubara.
I got permission to transplant those published on the following site.
- Takuya Matsubara's hobby page

- Since BG display is substituted by text display, it is considerably inferior to 3DS and WiiU. (But it is good)
